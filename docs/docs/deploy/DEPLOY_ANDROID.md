You need to decide if you want to build an app that will be shared with Google Play Store or if it will be sent directly to final users.

If it will be deployed to the store you should build an <b>app-bundle</b> (.aab) file otherwise an <b>apk</b> (.apk) file.

Configure buildType in eas.json as follows:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
        // ...rest of the properties
      }
    },
    "staging": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
        // ...rest of the properties
      }
    },
    "qa": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk" // you can choose here between apk and app-bundle
        // ...rest of the properties
      }
    }
  }
}
```
