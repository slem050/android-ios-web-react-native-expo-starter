# Build & deploy both Android and iOS apps

<ol>
  <li>
  Build and deploy the next version of Android and iOS simultaneously.  🌈 / 🕐 /📱

If you automated the submission process for Android and iOS (step build and deploy iOS app and step build and deploy Android app) you can build and upload both Android and iOS apps with just one command.

In project dir terminal run:

```bash
yarn deploy:[qa/staging/production]
```

Choose the proper app version depending on the environment for which you want to create a build.

CONGRATULATION !! 🥳🥳 You have just learned how to run the build and deploy process with just one command for both Android and iOS!
